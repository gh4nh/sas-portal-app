/*
 *  This sample shows how one can write a file to a directory
 *  that requests the admin to create the user's Portal Content Area (ie. permissions tree).
 *
 *  The intent is that the files in this directory will then be post processed
 *  either through a batch job that runs on a normal schedule, or to use system
 *  capabilities to trigger a sas job to run when the file is created.
 *
 *  Note that in this case, the _cptTreeExists macro variable should not be changed
 *  from the value at call this program (ie. 0), but this code can change the
 *  message being returned to the user interface, by setting the _cptErrorMessage
 *  macro variable.
